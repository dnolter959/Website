title: About me

Greetings! I am a former Data Scientist headed to graduate school for biostatistics. 
I love solving problems with data, and communicating results through writing - 
this blog is a place for me to do that! Other than that, I'm a big runner, and have 
run competitively since I was 12. I'm also a huge fan of the sport of professional track and field
and follow it closely.
