I really liked this book - but I knew what I was getting myself into since I listen to and consistently enjoy the podcast it's adapted from. I think John Green and I have a similar worldview and disposition, and so I tend to relate to his musings and observations that some of my friends are probably justified in characterizing as overly-earnest or sentimental.

In fact, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that I relate to his worldview because over the past 10 years, he and Hank have played a large role in *shaping* mine - probably more than anyone I know in real life. I've watched almost every vlogbrothers video since I found the channel in high school, and over the years many of their ideas have worked their way into my fundamental belief system. They've influenced my thinking on what role art ought to play in one's life, how to navigate hardships and locate hope in times of despair, how to be un-ironic and unabashed about the things you love, and how to be analytical without failing to be present. It's probably because of them that I even think about these things in the first place.

JG writes in the introduction that he was drawn to the Yelp-style review format because he wanted to be more mindful and deliberate about what he pays attention to - and that researching and writing these deep dives required sustained focus as a sort of cure for his fractured attention. For me, the experience of *reading* these essays also induced the sort of trance-like focus that I recall once being abundantly available, but which has eluded me during most of the pandemic. For that I'm grateful.

Like JG, I am also drawn to the review format. I love reading reviews, and of the writing projects I've completed, all of my favorites are book or movie reviews. I never really interrogated this fact until reading this book - where John cites his wife's contention that all reviews are to some extent *memoirs*, in the sense that they are one particular person's firsthand account of experiencing some work of art. In this way, they can't help but be deeply personal, even though they purport objectivity and analytical distance. I loved that instead of trying to obscure this fact, JG leans into it here by weaving his own life experiences into each review.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I love writing reviews because they let me pretend that I'm writing about something external to myself when I really am not. Or maybe less selfishly: I love reading reviews because they are constantly telling subtle personal stories of their reviewers in between the lines - and I enjoy the puzzle of learning about the reviewer in this indirect way.

JG often says "you are what you pay attention to" and so you really ought to pay attention to what you are paying attention to. I'm glad that I spent the last few days paying attention to this book.
